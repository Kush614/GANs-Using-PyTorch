# GANs-Using-PyTorch
Introduction
A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks conceived in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues. Two neural networks (Generator and Discriminator) compete with each other like in a game. This technique learns to generate new data using the same statistics as that of the training set, given a training set.
